## ✅ **Services Page Updated Successfully**

### **Final Implementation:**

#### **Updated Services Page (`lib/pages/services_page.dart`)**
- **Data Source**: Now queries `services` table with `user_id = auth.user.id`
- **No Status Filtering**: Shows all services regardless of their status (pending, approved, rejected)
- **Service Display**: Shows service name, description, price, service type, city, and creation date
- **Status Indication**: Visual chips showing "نشط" (active) or "غير نشط" (inactive)
- **Service Type Translation**: Added Arabic translation for service types

#### **Key Changes Made:**
1. **Data Loading**: Changed from `orders` to `services` table query
2. **UI Updates**: Updated app bar title and empty state text
3. **Service Card**: Redesigned to show service information instead of order information
4. **Status Display**: Updated to show service active/inactive status
5. **Service Type Names**: Added Arabic translation function

#### **Database Query:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM services 
WHERE user_id = auth.user.id 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

#### **Features Maintained:**
- **Pull to Refresh**: Maintained refresh functionality
- **Loading States**: Preserved loading and empty state handling
- **Error Handling**: Kept error handling with fallback data
- **UI/UX**: No changes to existing styling or layout
- **Navigation**: Preserved floating action button for adding new services

#### **Result:**
✅ Service providers can now see all their services regardless of status
✅ Comprehensive service information display
✅ Clear visual status indicators
✅ Preserved existing UI/UX design
✅ No breaking changes to other components

The Services page now correctly displays all services owned by the authenticated user from the Supabase `services` table, fulfilling the requirement to show all services without status filtering.
